## üè¶ DEBT SERVICE RATIOS - PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS

### ‚úÖ CORRECT USAGE (2025):
- **CMHC Insured Mortgages**: 39% GDS maximum, 44% TDS maximum
- **Conventional Mortgages** (20%+ down): 45% GDS maximum, 50% TDS maximum  
- **Conservative Bank Guidelines**: 30-32% GDS, 37-40% TDS (internal policies)

### ‚ùå NEVER WRITE:
- "32% GDS maximum" (without specifying mortgage type)
- "40% TDS maximum" (without specifying mortgage type)
- "Industry standard 32% and 40%" (outdated and incorrect)
- Generic ratios without CMHC vs conventional context

### üîÑ HISTORICAL CONTEXT:
- **July 2021**: CMHC increased from 35% GDS / 42% TDS to current 39% / 44%
- **Pre-2021 content** using old ratios must be updated

---

## üèõÔ∏è GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS - CURRENT STATUS

### ‚úÖ CORRECT USAGE:
- **First-Time Home Buyer Incentive**: DISCONTINUED March 2024
- **Home Buyers' Amount**: $1,500 federal tax credit (active)
- **RRSP Home Buyers' Plan**: $35,000 per person withdrawal (active)
- **Alberta**: NO provincial mortgage programs exist

### ‚ùå NEVER WRITE:
- "First-Time Home Buyer Incentive provides..." (without discontinuation notice)
- "Alberta government mortgage programs"
- "Provincial down payment assistance in Alberta"
- Any current benefits for discontinued programs

---

## üìà INTEREST RATES AND PREDICTIONS

### ‚úÖ CORRECT USAGE:
- "Current rates vary - contact for quote"
- "Bank of Canada qualifying rate (updated weekly)"
- "Rates subject to qualification and market conditions"
- Rate ranges with disclaimers only

### ‚ùå NEVER WRITE:
- Specific rate predictions ("5.79% fixed")
- "Guaranteed rates" or "locked rates" 
- Rate forecasts or future predictions
- Specific numbers without disclaimers

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è LEGAL AND COMPLIANCE

### ‚úÖ REQUIRED LANGUAGE:
- "Subject to qualification and approval"
- "This information is for educational purposes only"
- "Consult with qualified mortgage professionals"
- "Rates and programs subject to change"

### ‚ùå PROHIBITED LANGUAGE:
- "Guaranteed approval"
- "Guaranteed rates"
- "Guaranteed qualification"
- Any absolute promises or guarantees

---

## üìä VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before publishing ANY mortgage content, verify:

- [ ] **Debt service ratios specify mortgage type** (CMHC 39%/44% vs conventional 45%/50%)
- [ ] **Government programs include current status** (FTHB discontinued March 2024)
- [ ] **No specific rate predictions** (use "rates vary" language)
- [ ] **No guarantee claims** (use "subject to" language)
- [ ] **All statistics have date stamps** and verified sources
- [ ] **Compliance disclaimers included** on all content
- [ ] **Professional consultation recommended** for all advice

## üö® COMMON AI ERRORS TO AVOID

### 1. **Outdated Ratio Syndrome**
AI often defaults to old 32%/40% ratios. ALWAYS specify:
- CMHC insured: 39% GDS, 44% TDS
- Conventional: 45% GDS, 50% TDS

### 2. **Program Status Confusion**
AI may reference discontinued programs as active. VERIFY:
- FTHB Incentive = DISCONTINUED March 2024
- Home Buyers' Amount = ACTIVE $1,500 credit
- Alberta provincial programs = NONE EXIST

### 3. **Rate Prediction Trap**
AI loves making specific predictions. NEVER:
- Predict future rates
- Quote specific current rates
- Promise rate locks or guarantees

### 4. **Generic Advice Pitfall**
AI gives broad advice without professional disclaimers. ALWAYS:
- Include educational purpose disclaimers
- Recommend professional consultation
- Specify information limitations

## üí° PROFESSIONAL TIPS

1. **Context is King**: Always specify CMHC vs conventional when mentioning ratios
2. **Date Everything**: Market data, program status, rate information needs timestamps
3. **Disclaim Everything**: Legal protection requires comprehensive disclaimers
4. **Verify Twice**: Professional errors destroy credibility instantly
5. **Update Regularly**: Mortgage rules change - review quarterly

**üéØ Remember: One professional error can destroy years of SEO work and credibility. When in doubt, be more conservative and include more disclaimers.**
