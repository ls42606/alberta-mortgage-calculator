# Mortgage Renewal vs Refinancing: Understanding Your Options

When your mortgage term ends, you face an important decision: simply renew with your current lender or explore refinancing options. Understanding the differences, benefits, and processes can save you thousands of dollars and improve your overall financial situation.

## What is Mortgage Renewal?

**Mortgage Renewal** occurs when your current mortgage term expires (typically after 5 years), and you need to establish a new term. Your remaining principal balance gets renewed under new terms and interest rates.

**The Renewal Process**:
- Usually happens 4-6 months before your term expires
- Your current lender sends renewal documents
- You can accept, negotiate, or shop elsewhere
- No new mortgage application if staying with current lender
- No stress test required with current lender

## What is Mortgage Refinancing?

**Mortgage Refinancing** involves replacing your existing mortgage with a new one, either with your current lender or a different one. This can happen at renewal or mid-term by breaking your existing mortgage.

**Refinancing Reasons**:
- Access equity for home improvements, investments, or debt consolidation
- Switch to a better rate or different mortgage product
- Change amortization periods
- Remove someone from the mortgage
- Switch from variable to fixed rates (or vice versa)

## Key Differences Between Renewal and Refinancing

**Renewal**:
- Keep existing mortgage structure
- Usually just rate and term changes
- No stress test with current lender
- Minimal paperwork and fees
- Same mortgage amount (minus payments made)

**Refinancing**:
- Can change mortgage amount, structure, and terms
- Access to home equity (up to 80% of home value)
- Must pass stress test
- Full application process required
- Legal and appraisal fees typically required

## When to Consider Renewal

**You're Satisfied with Your Current Situation**:
- Happy with your current lender's service
- Comfortable with the rate being offered
- No need to access additional funds
- Want to minimize costs and paperwork

**Market Rates Aren't Significantly Better**:
- Current lender's rate is competitive
- Switching costs outweigh potential savings
- You value the convenience of staying put

**Simple Financial Needs**:
- Just need to continue your mortgage
- No major life changes requiring mortgage adjustments
- Prefer minimal disruption to your banking relationships

## When to Consider Refinancing

**Access to Better Rates**:
- Market rates are significantly lower than your renewal offer
- Your credit situation has improved
- You qualify for better mortgage products

**Need to Access Equity**:
- Home renovations or improvements
- Investment opportunities
- Debt consolidation at lower interest rates
- Education funding or major purchases

**Change Mortgage Structure**:
- Switch from variable to fixed (or vice versa)
- Change amortization period
- Add or remove someone from the mortgage
- Switch mortgage type or features

**Poor Service from Current Lender**:
- Dissatisfaction with customer service
- Limited product options
- Inflexible terms or features

## The Renewal Process

**Timeline**:
- 6 months before: Start researching options
- 4 months before: Receive renewal offer from current lender
- 3 months before: Shop other lenders if desired
- 1 month before: Finalize your decision

**Steps**:
1. **Review your renewal letter** carefully
2. **Compare rates** from multiple lenders
3. **Negotiate** with your current lender if needed
4. **Make your decision** and complete paperwork
5. **Sign new mortgage documents**

## The Refinancing Process

**Documentation Required**:
- Income verification (pay stubs, T4s, employment letter)
- Asset verification (bank statements, investment accounts)
- Credit check and mortgage application
- Property appraisal (usually required)
- Legal documentation

**Timeline**:
- 2-4 weeks for approval process
- Additional time for legal work and funding
- Plan for 30-45 days total if switching lenders

## Costs to Consider

**Renewal Costs**:
- Usually minimal if staying with current lender
- Possible rate negotiation costs
- Legal fees only if switching lenders

**Refinancing Costs**:
- Legal fees: $1,500-$3,000
- Appraisal fee: $300-$500
- Mortgage registration fees
- Title insurance
- Possible penalty for breaking current mortgage early

## Rate Shopping Strategies

**Get Multiple Quotes**:
- Contact at least 3-4 different lenders
- Use mortgage brokers to access wholesale rates
- Compare not just rates but terms and features

**Negotiate with Current Lender**:
- Use competing offers as leverage
- Ask about rate matching policies
- Consider the value of your relationship

**Consider Total Costs**:
- Don't focus solely on interest rates
- Factor in all fees and costs
- Calculate total cost over the term

## Stress Test Implications

**Renewal (Same Lender)**: No stress test required, making renewal easier if your financial situation has changed.

**Refinancing/Switching Lenders**: Must pass current stress test at the higher of your contract rate + 2% or 5.25%.

**Impact**: If you've taken on more debt or your income has decreased, you might not qualify to switch lenders even if better rates are available.

## Accessing Home Equity

**Refinancing Limits**: You can typically access up to 80% of your home's current value minus your existing mortgage balance.

**Example**: 
- Home value: $600,000
- Maximum mortgage: $480,000 (80%)
- Current mortgage: $350,000
- Available equity: $130,000

**Uses for Equity**:
- Home renovations (often best return on investment)
- Investment properties or portfolios
- Debt consolidation (if at lower rates)
- Education funding
- Starting a business

## Tax Implications

**Interest Deductibility**: If you use refinanced funds for investment purposes, the interest may be tax-deductible. Keep detailed records and consult with tax professionals.

**Capital Gains**: Generally, your principal residence is exempt from capital gains tax, but investment use of funds could have implications.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Auto-Renewal**: Simply accepting your lender's renewal offer without shopping around.

**Rate Fixation**: Focusing only on interest rates while ignoring other important features.

**Unnecessary Refinancing**: Paying high costs to access equity for non-essential purchases.

**Poor Timing**: Refinancing when rates are high without considering timing.

**Ignoring Penalties**: Not calculating the true cost of breaking your mortgage early.

## Special Considerations for Alberta

**Market Volatility**: Alberta's real estate market can be more volatile than other provinces. Consider how this affects your equity position.

**Employment Factors**: If you work in cyclical industries like energy, consider how job security affects your refinancing ability.

**Regional Lenders**: Alberta has several regional lenders and credit unions that might offer competitive rates and terms.

## Working with Professionals

**Mortgage Brokers**: Can compare options from multiple lenders and often access better rates than direct applications.

**Financial Advisors**: Help evaluate whether accessing equity makes sense for your overall financial plan.

**Tax Professionals**: Advise on tax implications of using refinanced funds for various purposes.

**Legal Professionals**: Ensure all documentation is properly completed, especially for complex refinancing situations.

## Making Your Decision

**Financial Analysis**: Calculate the total cost of each option over your planned ownership period.

**Risk Assessment**: Consider your job security, income stability, and interest rate risk tolerance.

**Future Plans**: Think about your medium-term plans for the property and your financial goals.

**Professional Guidance**: Get advice from mortgage professionals who understand your complete financial picture.

## Conclusion

Both mortgage renewal and refinancing serve important purposes depending on your situation. Renewal offers simplicity and lower costs when you're satisfied with your current arrangement. Refinancing provides opportunities to improve your mortgage terms, access equity, or better align your mortgage with changed financial goals.

The key is to start planning early, understand all your options, and make an informed decision based on your specific circumstances. Don't simply accept the first offer from your current lender â€“ take time to explore alternatives and negotiate the best possible terms.

Remember that mortgage decisions affect your finances for years to come. Invest the time to understand your options and work with qualified professionals who can guide you toward the best choice for your situation.
