# How Much Mortgage Can I Afford in Alberta

Determining your mortgage affordability in Alberta requires understanding Canadian lending standards, including the federal stress test and provincial considerations. This guide provides the calculation methods used by Alberta lenders.

## Canadian Debt Service Ratios

Alberta lenders use two key ratios to determine mortgage affordability:

**Gross Debt Service (GDS) Ratio**: Your housing costs should not exceed 32% of your gross monthly income. Housing costs include:
- Principal and interest payments
- Property taxes
- Heating costs
- 50% of condo fees (if applicable)

**Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio**: Your total monthly debt payments should not exceed 40% of your gross monthly income. This includes housing costs plus all other debt payments.

## The Federal Stress Test

Since 2018, all mortgage applications must qualify at the higher of:
- The Bank of Canada's 5-year benchmark rate
- Your contract rate plus 2%

This stress test applies to all mortgage applications in Alberta, regardless of down payment amount.

## Alberta-Specific Considerations

**Property Taxes**: Alberta property tax rates vary significantly by municipality. Calgary and Edmonton rates differ substantially from rural areas.

**Heating Costs**: Alberta's climate requires year-round heating considerations. Lenders typically estimate $150-250 monthly for heating costs.

**No Provincial Sales Tax**: Alberta's lack of PST provides more purchasing power compared to other provinces.

## Calculation Example

For a household with $80,000 annual income ($6,667 monthly):

**GDS Calculation (32% limit)**:
- Maximum housing costs: $2,133 monthly
- Less property taxes ($250): $1,883
- Less heating ($200): $1,683
- Available for principal/interest: $1,683

**Stress Test Application**:
Using current stress test rate of approximately 7%, this translates to roughly $350,000 maximum mortgage amount with 20% down payment.

## Income Documentation

Alberta lenders require consistent income documentation:
- T4 employees: Recent paystubs and Notice of Assessment
- Self-employed: Two years of complete tax returns
- Commission income: Two-year average
- Rental income: Lease agreements and tax filings

## Down Payment Requirements

**Minimum Down Payments**:
- 5% for homes under $500,000
- 5% on first $500,000, 10% on remaining portion
- 20% for homes over $1 million

**CMHC Insurance**: Required for down payments under 20%, with premiums ranging from 2.8% to 4.0% of the mortgage amount.

## Pre-Approval Process

Getting pre-approved in Alberta involves:
1. Income and debt verification
2. Credit score assessment (typically 650+ required)
3. Stress test calculation
4. Rate hold (typically 90-120 days)

## Professional Guidance

While these calculations provide estimates, mortgage qualification involves numerous variables specific to your situation. Consider consulting with Alberta mortgage professionals who understand provincial regulations and can access multiple lender options.
