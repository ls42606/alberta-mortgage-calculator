# How Much Mortgage Can I Afford in Alberta

Understanding your mortgage affordability is crucial when buying a home in Alberta. With competitive housing markets in Calgary and Edmonton, knowing your borrowing limits helps you set realistic expectations and make informed decisions.

## The Basics of Mortgage Affordability

In Canada, mortgage affordability is determined by two key debt service ratios:

**Gross Debt Service (GDS) Ratio**: This measures your monthly housing costs as a percentage of your gross monthly income. Housing costs include mortgage payments, property taxes, heating, and 50% of condo fees (if applicable). For insured mortgages (less than 20% down payment), the maximum GDS ratio is 39%. For conventional mortgages (20% or more down payment), it's 45%.

**Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio**: This includes all your housing costs plus other monthly debt payments like credit cards, car loans, and lines of credit. The maximum TDS ratio is 44% for insured mortgages and 50% for conventional mortgages.

## The Mortgage Stress Test

Since 2018, all mortgage applications must pass the federal stress test. This means you must qualify at the higher of:
- Your contract rate plus 2%
- The Bank of Canada's minimum qualifying rate (currently 5.25%)

This stress test reduces most people's borrowing capacity by 15-20%, but it ensures you can handle potential rate increases.

## Alberta-Specific Considerations

**Property Taxes**: Alberta has some of the lowest property tax rates in Canada. Calgary's mill rate is approximately 0.6-0.7%, while Edmonton's is around 0.9-1.0%. Lower property taxes mean more of your income can go toward the mortgage principal and interest.

**No Land Transfer Tax**: Unlike Ontario or BC, Alberta has no provincial land transfer tax, saving you thousands of dollars at closing. This allows you to put more money toward your down payment or closing costs.

**Employment Stability**: Alberta's economy is tied to the energy sector, which can be cyclical. Lenders may scrutinize employment history more carefully if you work in oil and gas industries.

## Down Payment Requirements

The minimum down payment depends on the purchase price:
- Homes under $500,000: 5% minimum
- Homes $500,000-$999,999: 5% on the first $500,000, 10% on the remainder
- Homes $1 million and above: 20% minimum

## Calculating Your Maximum Mortgage

To determine your maximum mortgage amount:

1. **Calculate your gross monthly income**
2. **List all monthly debt payments**
3. **Estimate monthly housing costs** (property taxes, heating, condo fees)
4. **Apply the stress test rate** to determine qualifying payment
5. **Use the GDS and TDS ratios** to find your limits

## Tips to Increase Your Affordability

**Pay Down Debt**: Reducing monthly debt payments directly increases your TDS capacity.

**Increase Your Down Payment**: A larger down payment means a smaller mortgage and potentially avoiding CMHC insurance.

**Consider a Co-Signer**: Adding a co-signer with good credit and income can significantly increase your borrowing power.

**Improve Your Credit Score**: A higher credit score can help you qualify for better rates, effectively increasing your affordability.

## Regional Variations in Alberta

**Calgary**: Average home prices range from $450,000-$600,000 depending on the area. New developments in the suburbs often offer better value.

**Edmonton**: Slightly more affordable than Calgary, with average prices around $400,000-$500,000. The city offers diverse neighborhoods at various price points.

**Rural Alberta**: Significantly more affordable housing options, but consider employment opportunities and commuting costs.

## Working with a Mortgage Professional

Given Alberta's unique economic factors and varying local markets, working with a knowledgeable mortgage professional is essential. They can:
- Navigate lender-specific requirements
- Find the best rates for your situation
- Explain local market conditions
- Help structure your mortgage for flexibility

## Conclusion

Determining your mortgage affordability in Alberta requires understanding federal regulations, local market conditions, and your personal financial situation. Use online calculators as a starting point, but always consult with a qualified mortgage professional for personalized advice.

Remember, the maximum amount you qualify for isn't necessarily what you should borrow. Leave room in your budget for unexpected expenses, rate increases, and life changes. A conservative approach will help ensure your homeownership experience remains positive for years to come.
